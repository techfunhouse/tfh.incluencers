<div class="about-notes">
A quote from a musical genius of 15th century from India that encourages us to acknowledge and appreciate those who have selflessly shared their knowledge, extended help to others, or made significant positive changes in society. These "great souls" can be teachers, mentors, leaders, or anyone who has left a lasting, positive influence through their thoughts and actions.
